<h1>Hello World</h1>
</p>Im from Clifton Park, N.Y and I went to highschool at Shenedehowa. While at high school I played soccer for the school team and a club team. I really enjoyed doing this as well as hanging out with friends, riding bikes, spikeball, and playing videogames.</p>

My favorite food is steak:
